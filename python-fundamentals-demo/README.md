# Python Fundamentals Demo

This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts and best practices. It's designed to showcase my understanding of Python fundamentals to potential employers.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Basic Data Types:** int, float, str, bool
- **Data Structures:** list, dict, set, tuple
- **Control Flow:** loops, conditionals
- **Functions:** including importing from modules, type hints, and docstrings
- **Lambda, Map, Filter:** functional programming basics
- **File I/O:** reading and writing files
- **Exception Handling:** try/except blocks
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** simple class usage
- **Unit Testing:** see `tests/` directory
- **Code Quality:** type hints, docstrings, and clean code style
- **All Utility Functions Demonstrated:** add, subtract, multiply, divide, reverse_string, is_palindrome

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-fundamentals-demo.git
   cd python-fundamentals-demo
   ```
2. Run the main demo:
   ```sh
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```sh
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main source code (with type hints and docstrings)
- `tests/` - Unit tests for all utility functions
- `requirements.txt` - (Optional) List of dependencies
- `.gitignore` - Excludes cache, venv, and editor files

## Code Quality

- All functions and classes use type hints and docstrings.
- Follows standard Python conventions for file and test structure.
- All utility functions are demonstrated and tested.
- Ready for further extension (e.g., CLI, logging, advanced features).
